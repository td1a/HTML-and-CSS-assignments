Debug instruction Required:

index.html is the page in question.
Now I have made the page layout almost correct and have a functioning photo gallery, however,

1. Overlay text cluttered in one line even the height is absolutely enough.
2. Cannot end flex for photo gallery. So if photo frames does not fill the row (like currently it is 3 per row, say if it ends with 2),
next section (form) will be sqeezed to the right. 
I want it to close as a section, so next section (form) will always start on a new line.
